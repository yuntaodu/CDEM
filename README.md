## code and data

The code is implemented by MATLAB and can be directly used.The three datasets used in CDEM are contained in `data` folder, the utils folder contains necessary functions.

# run code
You can run `run_imageclef.m`, `run_office31.m` and `run_office10.m` directly for the results of imageclef, office31 and office10 respectively.
