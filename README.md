# Cross-domain error minimization for unsupervised domain adaptation(CDEM)
This directory contains the code for paper Cross-domain error minimization for unsupervised domain adaptation.

## code and data


The code is implemented by MATLAB and can be directly used.The three datasets used in CDEM are contained in data folder, the utils folder contains necessary functions.

# run code
You can run run_imageclef.m, run_office31.m and run_office10.m directly for the results of imageclef, office31 and office10 respectively.
